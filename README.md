# Connect 4

## Rules

Connect 4 is a competitive 2 player game.

The primary goal in Connect 4 is to horizontally, vertically, or diagonally match up 4 of your game chips while simultaneously preventing your opponent from doing the same. Each player is only allowed to place one token per turn.

I ultimately decided to take on Connect 4 for my Unit 1 Project because it was a childhood favorite. . . .Of course the similarity to Tic-Tac-Toe didnt hurt either.
